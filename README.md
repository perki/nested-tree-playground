# Nested tree playground

Simple playground for testing nested tree logics from command line. 

`node index.js` 

Then you have several commands to 
- add node 
- delete node 
- remove node
- get children 
- get parents
- move node
- query with exclusion (SQLite only)

### Implementation 

- Arraybased: Simple Array with a set of nodes
- SQLite: demonstrator with SQLite
